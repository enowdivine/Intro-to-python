#Project: Time calculations in hours. A program that takes the input value of distance 
#         in miles and speed value in mph and calculate the arrival time in hours

# import turtle

# distance = turtle.numinput("Input", "Enter distance in miles")
# speed = turtle.numinput("Input", "Enter speed mph")

# time = distance / speed

test = float(123456)

print(f'{test}')
